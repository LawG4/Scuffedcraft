# Assets 

This system of files exists to allow the user to generate the assets, I want to do this so that I can more easily generate efficient assets. such as generating the main texture atlas for the regular blocks. I'm not sure how to add in other stuff such as irregular objects like doors, but we'll see when we get there.
